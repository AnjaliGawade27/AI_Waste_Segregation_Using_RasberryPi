AI_Waste_Segregation_Using_RasberryPi

♻️ AI-Based Smart Waste Classification System (Simulation)
This project is a simulated AI-powered Smart Waste Segregator system built using Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow. It classifies images of waste as Paper or Plastic and identifies hazardous waste (Plastic) requiring instant chemical clearance. The system displays predictions visually and simulates motor actions for sorting waste types.

📌 Features

🧠 Real AI model (.h5) used for prediction
📸 Image classification using Raspberry Pi-style simulation
🧪 Terminal and on-image messages for:
Waste type (Paper or Plastic)
Hazard warnings for non-degradable waste
Suggested action (Chemical Clearance / Not Required)
🖼️ Enlarged image preview with overlaid prediction and instructions
🚫 No hardware required — fully simulated environment
🔍 What This Project Proves

You can simulate an AI-powered waste segregation system without needing physical hardware.
AI can be trained to distinguish between recyclable and non-recyclable waste.
Visual and textual feedback adds an interactive experience.
A unique innovation: flagging hazardous waste (Plastic) and suggesting automated chemical clearance to support eco-sustainability.
